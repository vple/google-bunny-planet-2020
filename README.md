From a recruiter:

Requesting challenge…

New challenge “ring_in_the_new_year” below. You have until January 31st to solve it. 


Bunny Planet is in trouble and 2020 will never end without your help! Professor Boolean has stolen the bell to officially “ring in” 2021 and holds it in their zombie laboratory. Time is ticking and the bunnies are waiting to officially celebrate 2021!

You've been trying to gain entry to the zombie lab for a while now. To open the door, you need to enter a password on the keyboard connected to it. To that end, you've been watching and meticulously recording everything you can see around the entrance. You've finally had a big break when you were able to acquire the notes of the zombie technicians:


*--------*

Input:

anagram


Rotation table:

anagram$

nagram$a

agram$an

gram$ana

ram$anag

am$anagr

m$anagra

$anagram


Sort table:

agram$an

am$anagr

anagram$

gram$ana

m$anagra

nagram$a

ram$anag

$anagram


Output:

nr$aaagm

*--------*


After carefully studying the notes, you've managed to decipher them.  The string is treated as if it is wrapped around a ring, and that ring is rotated.


1) Start with the input string (Input)

2) append an end marker ($)

3) take the word and rotate it by moving the first character to the end.

4) add each rotation to a table and repeat (3) until you get back to the original order (Rotation table)

5) sort the rotations, with the end marker sorting to the end (Sort table)

6) take the final column as the output (Output)


The note also contains something that you have reason to suspect is the password after having been put through the above process.


*--------*

Output:

endrtednedd:/os....cp.rnnn.rhhps/.tt$sfeaiaaofd.ow.otooapa.asu./thhse

*--------*
